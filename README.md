Convert numbers up to 3999 to the Roman number system. https://www.codedex.io/projects/convert-roman-numerals-with-python

Novovation:
1) Protection against entering incorrect numbers
2) As few conditional if-else statements as possible.

Initially just wanted to play with a new to me dictionary system in python, for this task - fits perfectly :)
